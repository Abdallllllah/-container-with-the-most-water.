# Water Container Solution

This project contains a Python script (`p.py`) that calculates the most water a container can hold as described in the problem statement.

## Getting Started

To run this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

```bash
python p.py
```

Problem Statement:
Given a list of integers representing the height of bars, the script calculates the maximum amount of water that can be stored between two bars.

Example
Input: [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48,50,12,3444,50000,49000,50,67,4900,650000000,4567885,566778]

Output: The maximum amount of water a container can hold is 4567885 units.
Replace X with the actual output from your script.
